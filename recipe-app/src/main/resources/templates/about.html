    <p> Hey there, I'm Netra Amin, just a computer science student in my first year at the University of Georgia. 
        But here's the twist: I've got a passion for food that's almost as big as my love for coding. So, I cooked up something special for you â€” a recipe hub like no other. Why? Because we all love good food, right? 
        Here, you can find mouthwatering recipes from all around the world. </p>
